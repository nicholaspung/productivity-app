bugs

- account
  - on load, changes the styling because of the way it's coded
  - need styling for mobile

todos

- landing page
  - do something about that
- calendar
  - loading elements when checking out a new month
  - calendar needs a button to be able to sort/filter by something
- habit
  - add 'number of times finished in a row' functionality
    - can probably show on calendar for this, rather than on the habit itself
- account
  - if only on 1 login provider, tell user that they cannot disconnect provider
- loading screen
  - takes up entire screen for 1 second when loading
    - when the data is finished loading, load the data

    - quote can be stored on the browser
    - when loaded, quote will be shown underneath the header
